Welcome
============================
Here, you will find most of the material that I cover in the 5-weeks course "Stochastic Physics of the Molecules of Life".

A typical week consists of a lecture, a topic discussion with a paper, homework exercises, and the individual project.

The individual projects will be presentated by everyone in the last week.

If you have any questions, please contact me directly under f.m.berger@uu.nl

Have fun and enjoy the material!
Florian
