We will discuss the following questions:

1) What is the main question that Bialek explores in his lecture regarding the applicability of physics to biology?

2) What is the significance of Galileo's quote about the "book of nature" in the context of physics?

3) What are some examples of complex biological phenomena that Bialek presents in his lecture?

4) What is "universality" in physics, and how does it relate to the examples of vortices Bialek provides?

5) What is the main problem that Hodgkin and Huxley addressed in their work on the squid giant axon?

6) How many parameters are needed to describe the squid giant axon based on Hodgkin-Huxley's model, and how does this compare to describing a typical cell in the human brain?

7) What are the two ideas Bialek presents for addressing the contrast between physics and biology regarding parameters?
