Week 2: Discussion
=======================

We will discuss the following tutorial guide:

[How to count ion channels](https://www.doi.org/10.1152/advan.00006.2002)

You should be able to understand everything more or less until Fig. 6.

We will discuss the following questions:

1) What are the assumptions underlying equation (1)

2) Fig. 1: What is measured and what is changed in the experiment?

3) How is equation (1) related to the data shown in Fig. 1

4) Discuss and interpret the data shown in Fig.2. What are the differences between the columns?

5) What is plotted in Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6

6) What is channel rundown? How could this be included in equation (1)?

7) What is discussed in the rest of the paper?

8) What are possible issues when applying this method?
