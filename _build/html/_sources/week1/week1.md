Week 1: Introduction to Biophysics and some Math
=======================

In the first week, I give a motivation for Biophysics and we will introduce the tools we need to study the physics of fluctuations.

After this week, you are well prepared to understand what fluctuations can teach us about molecular mechanisms.
