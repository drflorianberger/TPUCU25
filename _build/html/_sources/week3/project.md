# Week 3: Project

In this week you should outline your presentation by formulating messages.

The goal of any presentation is to bring a message across. Therefor, the presentation must take into account the background of the audience and reduce the noise, such as visual clutter, not important information and so on. 

The difference between information and a message is that information is the answer to the question "what" and a message is the answer to the question "so what".

1) What is the study about and why did you pick it?
2) Why do you think it is important?
3) What is the added value for the research community / humanity?
4) Why was the study conducted only recently?
5) What are biophysical aspects of the study?
6) What would be a good follow-up of the study?
