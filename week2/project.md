In NotebookLM, you can create a space with the relevant sources. Here you can add the Quantamagazin article, links to other webpages, scientific papers, and other documents. 

Get creative and engage with the information. You can generate a study guide, exam questions, or even a Potcast if that helps you think about the material.

Your end goal is a final presentation for the last week. This presentation needs to address the following questions:

1) What is the study about and why did you pick it?
2) Why do you think it is important?
3) What is the added value for the research community / humanity?
4) Why was the study conducted only recently?
5) What are biophysical aspects of the study?
6) What would be a good follow-up of the study?
